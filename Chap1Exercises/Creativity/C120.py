# Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function shuffle(data) that accepts a  list of elements and randomly reorders the
# elements so that each possible order occurs with equal probability. The random module includes a  more basic function
# randint(a, b) that returns a uniformly random integer  from a to b (including both endpoints). Using only the randint
# function,  implement your own version of the shuffle function.
